# Mapping Health Access: A Geospatial and Predictive Analysis of Factors Influencing Health Facility Presence and Mortality Rates in the Philippines

## Abstract
This study explores the geographic distribution of public and private health facilities in the Philippines and examines the underlying demographic, socioeconomic, and population-based factors influencing their presence. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and geospatial mapping, the research visualizes disparities in health infrastructure across urban and rural areas. Key variables such as population density, income level, and age distribution are analyzed to understand their impact on facility availability. A predictive model is then developed to identify the statistical correlation between health facility density and local mortality & morbidity rates.

## Significance 
This is intended to highlight critical healthcare access gaps, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and provide evidence-based insights for policy interventions to achieve equitable healthcare distribution under the Universal Health Care (UHC) agenda (Republic Act No. 11223).
